# Domain 3 – Access Control Concepts (ISC² Certified in Cybersecurity)

---

## 0. Overview
**Domain Weight:** ~20% of CC Exam (estimated)  
**Study Time:** ~0.75 – 1.5 hours (adaptive pacing)

**Focus:**  
- Who gets access  
- What they have access to  
- Why access is necessary  
- How that access is managed  
- Both **physical** and **logical** controls

**Key Topics:**
- Security Control Protocols
- Access Control Strategies
- User Privilege Administration

---

## 1. Purpose of Access Control
**Definition:** The selective restriction of access to resources, ensuring only authorized users, programs, or processes can access certain assets.

**Goals:**
1. Enforce the principle of least privilege (users only get access needed for their role).
2. Protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA).
3. Reduce risk of insider threats and unauthorized access.

---

## 2. Categories of Access Controls

### 2.1 Physical Access Controls
Prevent or deter unauthorized physical access to facilities, equipment, and resources.

**Examples:**
- Locks (mechanical, electronic)
- ID badges and access cards
- Biometric scanners (fingerprint, retina)
- Security guards
- CCTV and surveillance systems
- Barriers, gates, and fencing
- Mantraps and turnstiles

---

### 2.2 Logical (Technical) Access Controls
Restrict access to computer systems, networks, and data through software or hardware mechanisms.

**Examples:**
- Passwords and passphrases
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Encryption
- Firewalls and intrusion prevention systems
- Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Directory services (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory)

---

## 3. Access Control Strategies

### 3.1 Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
- Resource owner decides who can access.
- Flexible but more prone to mismanagement.
- Example: File owner grants read/write permissions.

### 3.2 Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
- Central authority enforces access rules.
- Based on security classifications (e.g., Top Secret).
- Example: Military or government environments.

### 3.3 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Access granted based on job roles.
- Easier to manage in large organizations.
- Example: “Finance” role grants access to accounting systems.

### 3.4 Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- Access based on attributes (user, resource, environment).
- More dynamic and flexible.
- Example: User can only access data during business hours, from company devices.

## 4. User Privilege Administration

### 4.1 Key Principles
- **Least Privilege:** Only the minimum rights needed.
- **Need-to-Know:** Only access to information relevant to job duties.
- **Separation of Duties (SoD):** Split tasks between individuals to prevent fraud.
- **Privilege Creep:** Users accumulating access over time without need — must be avoided.

### 4.2 Account Management
- **Provisioning:** Creating user accounts with appropriate permissions.
- **De-provisioning:** Disabling/removing accounts when users leave or change roles.
- **Periodic Review:** Regularly checking permissions for accuracy.

---

## 5. Security Control Protocols
These protocols help enforce logical access control:

- **Authentication Protocols:**
  - Kerberos
  - RADIUS / TACACS+
  - SAML / OAuth / OpenID Connect

- **Authorization Protocols:**
  - Implement RBAC, ABAC, or MAC rules.
  - Enforce policies via policy decision points (PDP) and policy enforcement points (PEP).

- **Accounting/Auditing:**
  - Log user activity for accountability and forensic purposes.
  - Example: Tracking login attempts, resource access, and changes to critical files.

## 6. Exam Tips & Key Distinctions

| Concept | Key Point |
|---------|-----------|
| Physical vs Logical | Physical = tangible barriers, Logical = digital/system controls |
| DAC | Owner controls access |
| MAC | Central authority controls access |
| RBAC | Based on job role |
| ABAC | Based on attributes & conditions |
| Least Privilege | Minimum rights needed |
| SoD | Split tasks to reduce fraud risk |
| Privilege Creep | Avoid stale or unused permissions |

---

## 7. Common Threats to Access Control
- Weak or shared passwords
- Stolen access cards or tokens
- Social engineering attacks
- Poor account management
- Lack of regular access reviews
- Exploitation of unpatched systems

---

## 8. Best Practices
1. Implement MFA for sensitive systems.
2. Use strong, unique passwords with regular changes.
3. Automate account provisioning/de-provisioning.
4. Review access rights quarterly.
5. Apply encryption to sensitive data.
6. Train users on secure authentication practices.

## 9. Quick Reference Table

| Access Control Type | Example |
|---------------------|---------|
| Physical | Locks, guards, CCTV |
| Logical | Passwords, MFA, encryption |
| DAC | File owner sets permissions |
| MAC | Government clearance levels |
| RBAC | “HR role” grants payroll access |
| ABAC | Location-based or time-based restrictions |
