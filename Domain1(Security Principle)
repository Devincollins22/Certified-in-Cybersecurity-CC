## 1. Foundational Cybersecurity Concepts

### 1.1 Information Security vs Cybersecurity
- **Information Security (InfoSec):** Protects all forms of information (paper, digital, verbal).
- **Cybersecurity:** Focuses on protecting digital systems, networks, and data from cyber threats.

### 1.2 CIA Triad (Core of Info Assurance)
| Principle        | Definition | Examples |
|------------------|------------|----------|
| **Confidentiality** | Preventing unauthorized access to data. | Encryption, access control lists (ACLs), VPNs. |
| **Integrity** | Ensuring data accuracy and preventing unauthorized modification. | Checksums, hashing (SHA-256), digital signatures. |
| **Availability** | Ensuring systems and data are available when needed. | Redundancy, failover clusters, backups, UPS power. |

### 1.3 Additional Security Principles
- **Authentication:** Verifying identity before granting access.
- **Non-repudiation:** Ensuring a sender cannot deny having sent a message.
- **Privacy:** Controlling collection, use, and sharing of personal data.

---

## 2. Information Assurance (IA)
**Definition:** The practice of managing risks to information systems to ensure CIA principles are upheld.

**Key IA Activities:**
- Data classification and handling
- Access management
- Continuous monitoring
- Incident response planning

---

## 3. Risk Management

### 3.1 Key Terms
- **Risk:** Possibility of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.
- **Threat:** Any event or actor that can cause harm.
- **Vulnerability:** Weakness that could be exploited.
- **Impact:** Potential damage from a risk.
- **Likelihood:** Probability of risk occurrence.

### 3.2 Risk Management Process
1. **Identify** assets, threats, and vulnerabilities.
2. **Assess** risk (likelihood × impact).
3. **Treat** risk:
   - Accept
   - Avoid
   - Transfer (e.g., insurance)
   - Mitigate (e.g., controls)
4. **Monitor** and review periodically.

## 4. Security Controls

### 4.1 Control Categories
| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Administrative** | Policies, procedures, training. | Security awareness program, background checks. |
| **Technical** | Hardware/software mechanisms. | Firewalls, IDS/IPS, encryption. |
| **Physical** | Tangible measures. | Locks, CCTV, guards, fences. |

### 4.2 Control Functions
- **Preventive:** Stop incidents (e.g., firewalls, locks).
- **Detective:** Identify incidents (e.g., IDS, log monitoring).
- **Corrective:** Restore after incidents (e.g., backups, patching).

---

## 5. Governance Elements

### 5.1 Definitions
- **Policy:** High-level statement of intent (the “what”).
- **Procedure:** Step-by-step instructions (the “how”).
- **Standard:** Specific, measurable rules or benchmarks.
- **Regulation:** Mandatory requirements by a governing body.
- **Law:** Legal requirement enforceable by government.

### 5.2 Relationships
Policies guide standards → Standards inform procedures → Regulations & laws set external requirements.

---

## 6. ISC² Code of Ethics

### 6.1 Canons
1. Protect society, the common good, necessary public trust, and confidence.
2. Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally.
3. Provide diligent and competent service to principals.
4. Advance and protect the profession.

### 6.2 Example Application
**Scenario:** You find a critical vulnerability in a client’s system.  
**Appropriate action:** Privately inform the client, assist with mitigation, avoid public disclosure until fixed.

---

## 7. Identity Assurance

**Definition:** Confidence that a claimed identity is the correct one.

**Methods:**
- **Something you know:** Password, PIN.
- **Something you have:** Smart card, token.
- **Something you are:** Fingerprint, iris scan.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) = Two or more of the above.

---

## 8. Privacy Control Mechanisms

- **Data Minimization:** Collect only what’s needed.
- **Access Restrictions:** Role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Encryption:** Protect data in transit and at rest.
- **Consent Management:** Obtain and record user consent.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA.

---

## 9. Safeguarding Data

### 9.1 Data Classification
- Public
- Internal
- Confidential
- Restricted/Secret

### 9.2 Data Protection Lifecycle
1. **Create**
2. **Store**
3. **Use**
4. **Share**
5. **Archive**
6. **Destroy**

---

## 10. Strategic Risk Management

**Definition:** Aligning risk management with organizational goals and mission.

**Key Points:**
- Involves executive-level decision-making.
- Balances cost vs. benefit of controls.
- Considers business impact analysis (BIA).

---

## 11. Exam Tips & Memory Aids

- **CIA + PAN**: Privacy, Authentication, Non-repudiation.
- **Controls**: Think “ATP” – Administrative, Technical, Physical.
- **Risk Treatment**: “AATM” – Accept, Avoid, Transfer, Mitigate.
- Always relate security to **business objectives**.
- Know governance hierarchy: Policy → Standard → Procedure.
