# Domain 2 – Incident Response, Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery Concepts (ISC² Certified in Cybersecurity)

---

## 0. Overview
**Domain Weight:** ~20% of CC Exam (estimated)  
**Study Time:** ~0.75 – 1.25 hours (adaptive pacing)

**Focus:** Availability (CIA triad) — maintaining operations through disruptions by using:
- **Incident Response (IR)**
- **Business Continuity (BC)**
- **Disaster Recovery (DR)**

**Key Difference:**
- **IR:** Respond to incidents and contain damage.
- **BC:** Keep business running during crisis.
- **DR:** Restore operations to normal after major failure.

---

## 1. Why This Domain Matters
Cybersecurity is not only about preventing breaches — it’s about ensuring **human safety** and the **continuous operation of systems and services**, even when unexpected events occur.  
This includes:
- Protecting people’s personal information
- Preserving the health and safety of staff and customers
- Maintaining critical business functions

---

## 2. Incident Response (IR)

### 2.1 Definition
A structured approach for handling and managing the aftermath of a security incident or breach.

### 2.2 Goals
- Limit damage
- Reduce recovery time and costs
- Maintain business operations
- Preserve evidence for investigation

### 2.3 Incident Response Life Cycle (NIST Model)
1. **Preparation**
   - Create IR policies and procedures
   - Train the IR team
   - Ensure logging and monitoring are in place
2. **Detection & Analysis**
   - Identify indicators of compromise (IoCs)
   - Classify and prioritize incidents
3. **Containment**
   - Short-term: Limit immediate damage
   - Long-term: Prevent recurrence
4. **Eradication**
   - Remove root cause (malware, vulnerabilities)
5. **Recovery**
   - Restore systems to normal operation
   - Monitor for signs of weakness or reinfection
6. **Lessons Learned**
   - Conduct post-incident review
   - Update policies, training, and defenses

## 3. Business Continuity (BC)

### 3.1 Definition
The ability of an organization to maintain **essential functions** during and after a disaster, without significant interruption.

### 3.2 Goals
- Continue **critical business processes** despite disruptions
- Minimize operational downtime
- Protect brand reputation

### 3.3 Business Continuity Plan (BCP) Components
- **Business Impact Analysis (BIA):**
  - Identifies critical business functions
  - Determines Recovery Time Objective (RTO) & Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- **Continuity Strategies:**
  - Alternate work sites
  - Remote work capability
  - Redundant systems and network connections
- **Plan Documentation:**
  - Clear roles and responsibilities
  - Communication plans
  - Escalation procedures
- **Testing & Training:**
  - Tabletop exercises
  - Simulated outages

---

## 4. Disaster Recovery (DR)

### 4.1 Definition
Focused on **IT systems and infrastructure restoration** after a major incident or disaster.

### 4.2 Goals
- Restore systems and data to normal operations quickly
- Minimize data loss and downtime

### 4.3 DR Plan Components
- **Backup Solutions:**
  - Full, incremental, and differential backups
  - Cloud-based replication
- **Recovery Sites:**
  - **Hot site:** Fully equipped, ready to run immediately
  - **Warm site:** Partially equipped, requires some setup
  - **Cold site:** Space available, no pre-installed systems
- **Restoration Procedures:**
  - Prioritized system recovery order
  - Verification of restored data
- **Plan Testing:**
  - DR drills and failover testing

## 5. How IR, BC, and DR Work Together
| Plan | Trigger | Focus | Outcome |
|------|---------|-------|---------|
| **Incident Response** | Security incident detected | Containment & mitigation | Business continues without major interruption |
| **Business Continuity** | Crisis or disruption impacting normal operations | Keep essential functions running | Maintain minimal acceptable service levels |
| **Disaster Recovery** | BC efforts fail or large-scale disaster occurs | Restore IT systems and data | Full operational recovery |

---

## 6. Key Recovery & Continuity Concepts

### 6.1 Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
- Maximum acceptable **downtime** before operations are severely impacted.

### 6.2 Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- Maximum acceptable **data loss**, measured in time.

### 6.3 Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD)
- Longest time business can tolerate a disruption before unacceptable impact.

---

## 7. Human & Safety Considerations
- **First priority:** Protect lives before assets.
- Ensure **evacuation plans** are in place.
- Communicate clearly with employees, customers, and partners.

---

## 8. Exam Tips & Common Pitfalls

- **IR ≠ BC ≠ DR** — Know the differences and how they interact.
- IR is **reactive**, BC is **proactive**, DR is **restorative**.
- Understand **RTO vs RPO**:
  - RTO = “How fast can we be up?”
  - RPO = “How much data can we lose?”
- For recovery sites:
  - Hot site = fastest, most expensive
  - Cold site = slowest, cheapest
- Always test and update plans regularly.

## 9. Quick Reference Table
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| IR | Respond to incidents quickly to reduce damage |
| BC | Continue critical business functions during crisis |
| DR | Restore IT systems after major outage |
| RTO | Max downtime before operations are severely affected |
| RPO | Max data loss acceptable |
| MTD | Longest disruption tolerated |
| Hot Site | Fully operational alternate site |
| Warm Site | Partially equipped alternate site |
| Cold Site | Facility with no ready equipment |
