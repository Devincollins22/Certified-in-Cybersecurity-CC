Networking: What is Networking?

A network is when two or more computers are linked together to share data, resources, or services.
This can include printers, internet, files, or communication tools.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LAN vs WAN:
- LAN (Local Area Network): Covers a small area (like one room, floor, or building)
- WAN (Wide Area Network): Connects distant networks over large areas (like cities or countries)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key Network Devices:
_Hubs_
- Basic device that connects multiple devices
- Sends data to all ports (no intelligence).
- Rarely used in modern business networks.

_Switches_
- Smarter than hubs
- Know the MAC addresses if connected devices
- Send data only to the specific device (more efficient).
- Can be used to create VLANs

_Routers_
- Connects multiple networks together (LAN to WAN)
- Route traffic using IP addresses
- Can be wired or wireless
- Choose the most efficent path for data

_Firewalls_
- Security device that filters traffic
- Blocks or allows traffic based on rules (Acess Control Lists)
- Used between internal neyworks and the internet, or between internal segments
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Common Network Components:
_Server_
- A computer that provides resources or services (ex, web server, mail server).
- Servers are usally hardened (secured more than workstations)
- Serve multiple clients over the network

_Endpoints_
- Any device that connects to a network
- Examples: Laptops, desktops, smartphones, tablets.
- One side of a network communication (client or server)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Standards:

_Ethernet_
- Standard for wired networking
- Defines how data is formatted and transmitted over cables 
- Makes sure devices speak the same language on a wired network
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Networking at a Glance:

_Small Business Network_
- Router, firewall, and network switch are separate devices
- All devices (workstations, servers, printers) connect through a central switch
- A firewall is placed between the switch and the internet to control traffic

_Home Network_
- Often uses a single combined device (modern + router + Wi-Fi access point).
- Connects multiple devices like phones, laptops, tablets, and desktops
- Simpler setup compared to a business network.

What is WiFi?
WiFi is a wireles networking technology that allows devices to connect to a network without physical cables. It's commonly used in homes and businesses
due to easy setup and low cost. Devices can move freely within range of wireless access points, making networking more flexible. However, WiFi introduces new security risks.
Unlike netwroks that require physical access, attackers can attempt to breach wireless netwrokrs remotely if within signal range. As WiFi standards evolve, each 
version becomes faster, but also requires updated security practices to stay protected
