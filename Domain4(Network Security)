Networking: What is Networking?

A network is when two or more computers are linked together to share data, resources, or services.
This can include printers, internet, files, or communication tools.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LAN vs WAN:
- LAN (Local Area Network): Covers a small area (like one room, floor, or building)
- WAN (Wide Area Network): Connects distant networks over large areas (like cities or countries)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key Network Devices:
_Hubs_
- Basic device that connects multiple devices
- Sends data to all ports (no intelligence).
- Rarely used in modern business networks.

_Switches_
- Smarter than hubs
- Know the MAC addresses if connected devices
- Send data only to the specific device (more efficient).
- Can be used to create VLANs

_Routers_
- Connects multiple networks together (LAN to WAN)
- Route traffic using IP addresses
- Can be wired or wireless
- Choose the most efficent path for data

_Firewalls_
- Security device that filters traffic
- Blocks or allows traffic based on rules (Acess Control Lists)
- Used between internal neyworks and the internet, or between internal segments
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Common Network Components:
_Server_
- A computer that provides resources or services (ex, web server, mail server).
- Servers are usally hardened (secured more than workstations)
- Serve multiple clients over the network

_Endpoints_
- Any device that connects to a network
- Examples: Laptops, desktops, smartphones, tablets.
- One side of a network communication (client or server)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Standards:

_Ethernet_
- Standard for wired networking
- Defines how data is formatted and transmitted over cables 
- Makes sure devices speak the same language on a wired network
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Networking at a Glance:

_Small Business Network_
- Router, firewall, and network switch are separate devices
- All devices (workstations, servers, printers) connect through a central switch
- A firewall is placed between the switch and the internet to control traffic

_Home Network_
- Often uses a single combined device (modern + router + Wi-Fi access point).
- Connects multiple devices like phones, laptops, tablets, and desktops
- Simpler setup compared to a business network.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is WiFi?
WiFi is a wireles networking technology that allows devices to connect to a network without physical cables. It's commonly used in homes and businesses
due to easy setup and low cost. Devices can move freely within range of wireless access points, making networking more flexible. However, WiFi introduces new security risks.
Unlike netwroks that require physical access, attackers can attempt to breach wireless netwrokrs remotely if within signal range. As WiFi standards evolve, each 
version becomes faster, but also requires updated security practices to stay protected
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Microsegmentation:

Microsegementation is a logical approach to isolating systems, users, or applications within a network using software-defined rules.
It controls how individual entities can communicate, enforcing security at a fine-grained level.\

_Ket Features_
-  Granular Access Rules
      - Control communication per device, user IP, port, time, or service
      - Example: Allow server A to talk to Server B only during backups, using specific creditals
- Breaks network into small, secure segments
- Uses software rules (no extra hardware)
- Controls traffic between individual devices, users, or apps
- Can allow/deny by:
       - IP address
       - Time of day 
       - Credentials
       - Specific services
- Stops lateral movements of threats
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intrusion Detection Systems(IDS):

What is an IDS?
- Monitors logs and real-time events to detect abnormal or spacious activity
- Part of defense in depth, works with (not replaces) firewalls
- Detects external attacks (ex> from internet) and internal spread (ex> worms.
- Responds by sending alerts or alarms for timely response
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDS Types:
1. Host-Based IDS (HIDS)
      - Monitors one computer (process calls, system/app/security logys, firewall logs.)
      - Detects file changes, processes used by attackers, remote contorl infections
      - More detailed analysis than NIDS
      - Higher cost- needs admin on each host
      - Cannot detect network attacks on other systems
2. Network-Based IDS (NIDS)
      - Monitors network traffic patterns at key points (routes, firewalls, switches).
      - Can detect attacks in progress but not if they succeeded
      - Cannot inspect encrypted traffic content
      - Centralized management via remote sensors
      - Low performance impact
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDS vs IPS:
IDS = Detects and alerts.
IPS = Detects and blocks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):

- Collects log data from many sources across the enterprise.
- Helps identify threats and allocate security resources.
- Works with IDS/NIDS/HIDS in defense-in-depth.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Network Segmentation: Demilitarized Zone (DMZ):

What is a DMZ?
- A seperate network segment that acts as a bufferzone between the public internet and an internal network
- Hosts public-facing services  (e.g., web servers, email servers, DNS) while keeping the internal network isolated.

Purpose: 
- Reduce the risk of attackers reaching the internal network.
- If a DMZ system is compromised, attackers don’t gain direct access to internal resources.

How it Wortks:
Firewalls control traffic:

One firewall between internet ↔ DMZ
Another firewall between DMZ ↔ internal network
Only specific, necessary traffic is allowed.
Example
Allowed: Public access to a company website in the DMZ.
Blocked: Direct internet access to internal databases.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Virtual Private Network (VPN):
 What is a VPN?
      - Point-to-point connection between two hosts.
      - Not always encrypted — encryption only if security protocols are selected & configured.
      - Creates a trusted path over an untrusted network (like the internet).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) – Quick Notes

What is a VLAN?
      - Software-based LAN segment created using network switches.
      - Groups devices logically, not by physical location.
      - Devices in the same VLAN communicate as if on the same Layer 2 network.

Key Features:
Can be configured by:
      - Switch port
      - IP subnet
      - MAC address
      - Protocol

- Limits broadcast traffic to the VLAN → reduces congestion & some attacks.
- Easy to reconfigure when users move or need different services.
- Inter-VLAN communication requires routing.

Limitations:
VLANs do not guarantee security.
Vulnerable to VLAN hopping attacks (malicious user can intercept other VLAN traffic).
Should be combined with other security measures.

Benefits: 
Segregates or consolidates traffic.
Simplifies network administration.
Improves performance and control.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Redundancy:

What is Redundancy?
      - Designing systems with duplicate components so if one fails, another takes over
      - Ensures high availabiltiy and minimal downtime

Examples in Data Centers:
      - Multiple utility service entrances for communications/power.
      - Two power supplies per device, connected to different sources.
      - Backup batteries and generators.

In high-availability setups:
      - Redundant generators
      - Different fuel types for extra resilience.
