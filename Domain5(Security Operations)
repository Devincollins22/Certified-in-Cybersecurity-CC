# Domain 5: Security Operations — Introduction

Security Operations focuses on the **daily activities** that keep an organization secure and resilient.  
It involves **monitoring, incident response, disaster recovery, and ongoing maintenance** of security controls.

## Key Goals
- **Monitor & Detect** – Identify suspicious activity through logs, alerts, and monitoring tools.  
- **Respond & Recover** – Contain threats, restore systems, and prevent repeat incidents.  
- **Maintain Operations** – Ensure critical services keep running during disruptions.  
- **Enforce Controls** – Apply least privilege, patch management, backups, and secure configurations.  
- **Support Investigations** – Preserve evidence, follow chain of custody, conduct forensic analysis.

## Why It Matters
Security Operations ensures **policies are actively enforced** and threats are handled in real time,  
minimizing business impact.

## Data Handling

Data goes through a **life cycle** as it is created, used, shared, stored, and eventually destroyed.  
Understanding this cycle helps ensure security controls are applied at each stage.

### Data Security Life Cycle Stages
1. **Create** – Data is generated, often as tacit knowledge (ideas, raw information).  
2. **Store** – Data is saved in a way that makes it explicit and retrievable.  
3. **Use** – Data is accessed, processed, or modified.  
4. **Share** – Data is transferred or made accessible to others.  
5. **Archive** – Data is stored long-term when not actively needed.  
6. **Destroy** – Data is securely erased or physically destroyed when no longer required.

### Data States
- **In Use** – Actively being processed by applications or viewed by users.  
- **At Rest** – Stored on physical or cloud storage devices.  
- **In Motion** – Transmitted across networks.

### Why It Matters
- Security policies must protect **all stages** and **all states** of data.  
- Aligning life cycle management with roles ensures **accountability** and **compliance**.
